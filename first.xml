*GIT STASH-
           Git stash tempororily saves you've made to your working copy so you con work on something else, and 
           then copy back and re-apply them later on. stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch contex and 
           work on something else, but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.
